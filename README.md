# Sentimental-Analysis
The project presents a sophisticated machine learning model designed to classify customer sentiment from product reviews. By harnessing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model accurately interprets and categorizes emotions expressed in textual feedback on a scale of 10. This automated sentiment analysis tool empowers businesses to gain deeper insights into customer satisfaction.

The tech stack for the sentiment analysis project includes machine learning algorithms for NLP, data processing libraries, and a backend framework to manage the applications operations and user interactions.
